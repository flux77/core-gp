# core-gp
Common Lisp library for GP-based algorithms. It allows standard GP, Strongly-Typed GP, Grammatical Evolution as well as standards GAs. The aim was to have a Lisp library that would have all the major GP paradigms. The code was not optimized for speed and in some cases, it's a bit . Still, it can be used and be useful. 

The current code is no longer in active development.
